# Welcome to Multi-User Painting App Guide!

This app coded with **Java**. We used **OOP**, **TCP ** for communication and **Java Swing** for visual graphics. 


## How to Run

First of all you need to open TCP server port at 8000. Later you can run main class and connect to the server. If you want to communicate with your other devices, you have to give a permission with enter that device's IP address to the relevant draw frame section.
